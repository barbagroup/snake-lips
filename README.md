Arboreal snakes of the species *Chrysopelea paradisi* gained the ability to glide through the air.
The so-called "gliding snake" jumps from tree branches and produces lift by expanding its rib cage (morphing its circular cross-section into a triangular shape).
During the gliding phase, the snake also undulates by sending waves from head to tail.
The S-like body can be viewed a series of straight sections connected connected with curved segments.
The three-dimensional kinematics of the gliding snake is highly complex.
Here, we consider a simplified geometry and focus on one of the straight sections.
The section is modeled as a cylinder with an anatomically accurate cross-section of the gliding snake.

One of the remarkable features of the cross-section is the formation of ventrally oriented lips when expanding the ribs.
The lips run along most of the body, producing a concave ventral surface.
In this study, we aim to quantify the role of the lips on the aerodynamics of the snake model.
Our strategy is to modify the cross-section of the gliding snake by removing one of the lips or both and quantify the relative change in the aerodynamic performances compared to the model with both lips.
The anatomically accurate cross-section of the snake *Chrysopelea paradisi* is available on [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.705877.v1)[1].
